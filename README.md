# 🏡 Real Estate Price Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Real Estate Price Predictor** is a web application that estimates real estate prices based on user input. It utilizes a trained **neural network model** to predict property values using features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and property age. The model is trained using synthetic real estate data and supports **persistent storage** via `localStorage` to avoid retraining.

## ✨ Features
✔️ **Predict real estate prices** based on user-provided inputs.  
✔️ **Visualize predicted vs. actual prices** with interactive charts using Recharts.  
✔️ **Persistent model storage** with `localStorage` to save and reuse the trained model.  
✔️ **Responsive and modern UI** with a gradient background and centered form.  
✔️ **Deployable** on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
